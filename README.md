# E-Negotiation-Framework-with-E-Commerce

This Project mainly use in increase in technology day by day there is tremendous increase in use of social
networking site. Electronic trading (E-trading) provides a virtual marketplace (E- marketplace) where
buyers and sellers can engage in business activities through electronic media rather than directly physical
contact. Although negotiation is a fundamental component of e –trading, the critical risk of missing out on
top utility offers that expire before client’s negotiation deadline has not been addressed.We evaluated the
performance of the proposed strategy in terms of client’s utility and negotiation time compared this two
baseline negotiation strategies. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed strategy maximizes
client’s utility, shortens negotiation time and ensure adequate market search. Proofs of validity of the
proposed utility function are presented. The security protocol is formally verified and the verification
shows that the protocol is free of security flaws hence the negotiation data are secured.
